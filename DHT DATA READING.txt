MCU START: 18ms LOW
MCU WAIT:  20-40us HIGH

DHT Response: 80us LOW
DHT prep sending data: 80us HIGH

DATA sending(everybit of data begins with 50us): 50us LOW

0: 26-28us HIGH
1:70us	HIGH

CHECK length of HIGH: 0/1

so for 8 bit it looks like this

[ DATA SENDING > CHECK length of HIGH ] = THIS IS 1 BIT


TEST:

0101-0100 = 84
0000-0000 = 0
0001-1110 = 30
0000-0000 = 0
0111-0010 = 114 (check SUM)
